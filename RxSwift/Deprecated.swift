/// Variable is a wrapper for `BehaviorSubject`.
///
/// Unlike `BehaviorSubject` it can't terminate with error, and when variable is deallocated
/// it will complete its observable sequence (`asObservable`).
///
/// **This concept will be deprecated from RxSwift but offical migration path hasn't been decided yet.**
/// https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/issues/1501
///
/// Current recommended replacement for this API is `RxCocoa.BehaviorRelay` because:
/// * `Variable` isn't a standard cross platform concept, hence it's out of place in RxSwift target.
/// * It doesn't have a counterpart for handling events (`PublishRelay`). It models state only.
/// * It doesn't have a consistent naming with *Relay or other Rx concepts.
/// * It has an inconsistent memory management model compared to other parts of RxSwift (completes on `deinit`).
///
/// Once plans are finalized, official availability attribute will be added in one of upcoming versions.
